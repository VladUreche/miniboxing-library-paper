\section{Improving The Programmer Experience}

\paragraph{}
% Programmer experience can be improved in two ways:
%	-by giving performance advisories in a form of compile time warnings
%	-by exposing the internal state using MbReflection ( in runtime check how code was transformed)
% In this secton we will explain what are performance advisories, why are they important and how can help programmer to improve the performance of his code
% Similar for MbReflections, say what will be covered

\subsection{Performance Advisories}
\paragraph{}
% 2 problems:
%	- programmer not aware of possible optimizations in the code
%	- programmer not aware of limitations of optimizer
% Silent failure - using performance advisories this is avoided
% Shown in form of compile-time warnings
% Improve code performance up to 5 times
\paragraph{}
% On the high level - two types of warnings saying that code is not optimal
%	- backwards => at the use site optimizer realizes that code can be optimized by adding annotation at the definition site, by going backward in the code
%	- forward => from the definition site, checks if code is optimized on the use site
\paragraph{}
% Example for backward warning + explanation
% Example for forward warning + explanation
% Example for limitation warning + explanation
\paragraph{}
% Programmer may be aware of his suboptimal code and warnings are not needed in that case
% Turning off all the warnings is too coarse-grained
% Possibility to suppress warnings from both the definition-site or the use-site site by adding @generic annotation for type param
% Example + explanation

\subsection{Exposing internal state - MbReflection}
\paragraph{}
% Besides compile time warnings that code is not optimized, it would be good to guard from those cases in the runtime 
% MbReflection gives programmer a possibility to check in runtime whether the type paramater is miniboxed, what is the actual type of the type parameter and what type is used to store it
% No overhead since they are compiled away by the miniboxing plugin
\paragraph{}
%Examples
%	-Example for checking the actual type of the type param and store type
%	-Example showing use case when we expect that class has to be always miniboxed
