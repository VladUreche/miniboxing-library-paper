% Most optimizations => compromises => heuristics => opaque to programmers => hinders productivity
Productivity in modern software development is achieved using high-level languages that allow programmers to focus on the problem domain and the requirements. The high-level programs are then transformed by compilers into low-level implementations that, when executed, produce the desired result. However, this translation is usually conservative and defensive. In checked languages for example, accessing an array twice in a sequence, even using the same index, produces two array bound checks.

With programming languages targeting a higher and higher level  Therefore program optimizations are a crucial component of enabling productivity, since they bridge the performance gap between a high-level program and a low-level, hand-coded


\topic{Program optimizations are compromises.} For example, inlining can be both good and bad.

\topic{Heuristics are key.}

\topic{Ultimately, heuristics hinder productivity.}
