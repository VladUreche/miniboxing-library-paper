\section{Conclusion}

\vspace{-0.5em}

This paper shows several approaches to allowing different generics compilations schemes to interoperate without incurring performance regressions:

\begin{compactitem}
\item Harmonizing the generics compilation scheme thanks to actionable performance advisories;
\item Bridging the gap between library constructs that use different generics compilation schemes, specifically:
  \begin{compactitem}
    \item The accessor approach;
    \item The replacement approach;
    \item The advisory-based approach.
  \end{compactitem}
\end{compactitem}

The implementation results are validated using the miniboxing plugin, showing performance improvements for each approach, with speedups ranging between 2x and 5x.
