\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we presented several approaches to avoiding slow paths in the opportunistic miniboxing transformation. These include:

\begin{compactitem}
  \item Performance advisories;
  \item Runtime performance reflection;
  \item Collaborating with hostile API by:
  \begin{compactitem}
    \item Offering optimized accessors;
    \item Replacing object representation;
    \item Proposing new API.
  \end{compactitem}
\end{compactitem}

With these approaches, by analyzing and matching the solution to the problem, the miniboxing specialization obtains speedups between 2 and 14x on different benchmarks developed by th  e community without sacrificing the high-level nature of programs and without requiring the developers to understand the underlying miniboxing transformation.
